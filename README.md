# Godot 2D Platformer (Learning Project)

This is my first **Godot Engine** project, created while learning in the  
**Basics of Game Development** course for my **MSc in Digital Learning Games** at **Tallinn University (2025)**.

The project is inspired by classic platformers like *Super Mario*, but it is still **incomplete**.  
I’m using this project mainly to explore the fundamentals of Godot and 2D game development.
